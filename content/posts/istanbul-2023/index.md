description: This is the description of the Istanbul 2023 post
summary: Istanbul previously known as Constantinople, a city so rich and strategic even the Romans were eager to claim it as a new capital replacing old Rome. It is at the center of many conjectures. Connecting Asia and Europe through land and sea. A city where the east and west harmoniously converge and diverge. There is no color, taste, or sight that you will not experience in Istanbul. Truely the crown jewel of all cities and the epicenter of the present now.
