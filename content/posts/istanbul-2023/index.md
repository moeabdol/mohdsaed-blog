description: This is the description of the Istanbul 2023 post
summary: Istanbul previously known as Constantinople, a city so rich and strategic even the Romans were eager to claim it as a new capital replacing old Rome. It is at the center of many conjectures. Connecting Asia and Europe through land and sea. A city where the east and west harmoniously converge and diverge. There is no color, taste, or sight that you will not experience in Istanbul. Truely the crown jewel of all cities and the epicenter of the present now.

## Home Away From Home
---
Wither you are from the east or the west, Turkey is a soup of cultures that have
moved through or settled in since ancient times. There are no minorities or a
predominant majority, people are of all colors, ethnecities, and religions.
Mosques next to Churches and Kebabs served with noodles. I never felt astranged
in Istanbul; on the contrary, I always felt at home.

## Constantinople
---
There is a tremendious amount of history that you'll encounter in Istanbul. You
can feel it as you walk down the streets and watch as the building stones change
shape, texture and color. Some of these stones and buildings have been there for
hundreds or even thousands of years.

Constantinople - modern day Istanbul - is an ancient city. Its location is very
strategic as it's located at the fronsteps of Europe. It also is a gateway
connecting two seas and making land and sea trades possible between Afric, Asia
and Europe.
