## First Encounter

I have first encountered the Kinesis back in 2012. Back then I was studying for
my master's degree in Tokyo, Japan. During my lab hours, I sat next to **Haru**
a PhD student working on advanced game algorithms. He had an Arch Linux box
running without a mouse and without any GUI whatsoever! On the other hand, I was
proudly rocking my 2010 Apple MacBook Pro stuffed with applications I have
bought from the App Store. I was a hardcore Apple fanboy, but I always kept
peeking across at Haru's setup and thinking to myself this is ridiculous!

Haru rarely spoke, as he knew very little English, and I very little Japanese.
Whenever we spoke, it was hilarious as our debates usually turn into infant
level English or Japanese. None the less, we have enjoyed each other's company
and shared a mutual silent respect knowing we are all nerds in different ways.

Haru was amazing! He did everything from the terminal. From writing code to
surfing the Internet to sending emails and more. I was astonished to watch him
do the things he do with a handful of tools.

What struck me the most in Kinesis's design, was the concave key-wells it had. I
didn't understand the reason behind the design, and thought it was defiantly
aesthetics. It put me off at the beginning thinking if I got used to that I
might end up forgetting how to type on a regular keyboard.
