description: This is my review of the Kenisis Advantage 2 ergonomic keyboard.
summary: The Kenisis Advantage 2 is the final successor to the Kenisis Advantage line. It is the apex of ergonomic keyboards. Loved by writers and programmers from all around the world. If you have wrist or arm pains while typing, then look no further. If you spend countless hours in front of your computer typing, then this is for you. This mechanical keyboard is built with ergonomics and speed in mind. No more finger twisting key combinations, or over-reaching pinkie strokes. Your long forgotten thumbs will awaken from their deep space slumber and help you reach new combinations.
