description: This is my review of the Kenisis Advantage 2 ergonomic keyboard.
summary: The Kenisis Advantage 2, the final successor in the Kenisis Advantage line is the epidamy of ergonomic keyboards. Loved by typists and programmers alike from all around the world. If you have wrist or arm pains while you type, then you have come to the right place. This mechanical keyboard is built with ergonomics in mind. No more finger twisting key combinations. No more over-reaching pinkie strokes. Your long forgotten thumbs will awaken from their deep space slumber and reach places you have never imagined.
